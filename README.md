# Hello there!
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm paritojr, a web developer. I like programming in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sometimes, I make apps in [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).
After i made a program, I share it's code through GitHub so people can catch a bug, add new features, etc.
See you there!
